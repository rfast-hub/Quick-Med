AI Health App
The AI Health App is a subscription-based platform that allows users to upload bloodwork and physical data for personalized health recommendations. The AI analyzes the data to provide tailored suggestions on supplements, workout plans, and nutrition, based on each userâ€™s age, gender, weight, and height. Additionally, the app features an interactive 3D human model where users can pinpoint areas of pain for AI-driven diagnostics. Built with React.js for the frontend and Flask/Node.js for the backend, this app offers a seamless experience for health monitoring and improvement.
